h1. Genere Fiction Generator

This is an implementation of Wondermark's Genre fiction generator in Duby.

h2. Running

The program is just a script, duby run the story maker file to generate a thrilling synopsis of your story.

h2. Issues

Although the string interpolation and array functionality are great, I've failed to get maps to work in a Ruby like way and ended up with something quite verbose and I have yet to get the closure working to remove the duplication in the creation of the story data.

The a/an issue also needs to be resolved.
